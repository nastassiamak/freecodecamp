// Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, 
// and fixing them.
//
//  In this project, you will help CamperBot build a random background color 
//  changer and help them find and fix errors.

// Step 1 
// CamperBot is trying to build out a random background color changer. But they keep running into issues and need your help to debug the code.
//
//     CamperBot has already added the HTML and CSS for the project. But they are confused as to why none of the styles and content is showing up on the page.
//
//     When they open up the console they see this message:
//
//     Example Code
// SyntaxError: unknown: Unexpected token, expected "," (5:2)
// Syntax errors are thrown when the JavaScript engine encounters something it can't interpret. In this case, it looks like CamperBot has syntax errors in the darkColorsArr array.
//
// Fix the syntax errors in the darkColorsArr array and you should see the content and styles show up on the page.

const darkColorsArr = [
    "#2C3E50",
    "#34495E",
    "#2C2C2C",
    "#616A6B",
    "#4A235A",
    "#2F4F4F",
    "#0E4B5A",
    "#36454F",
    "#2C3E50",
    "#800020",
];

// Step 2 
// Now, CamperBot is trying to create a function that will return a random index from the darkColorsArr. But they have run into the following error message:
//
//     Example Code
// Uncaught ReferenceError: math is not defined
// A ReferenceError is thrown when a non-existent variable is referenced. In this case, it looks like CamperBot is trying to use math but JavaScript doesn't have a math object.
//
// Fix CamperBot's error in the math.random() line and open up the console again.

// Step 3 
// Now that the ReferenceError is resolved, the console is displaying the correct results for a random number between 0 and 9. But CamperBot was not expecting to see decimal numbers like these:
//
//     Example Code
// 0.015882899879771095
// 2.114596286197641
// 6.040964780197666
// Update the console statement to print a whole number between 0 and 9.
//
// Remember that you worked with a method in the Role Playing Game that rounds a number down to the nearest whole number.
 function getRandomIndex() {
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(darkColorsArr.length * Math.random());
    return randomIndex;
}

// Step 4 
// CamperBot is finished with building out the getRandomIndex function and it is working as expected.
//
//     But now they are running into this issue when trying to create a reference to the body element in the DOM:
//
//     Example Code
// Uncaught TypeError: document.queryselector is not a function
// A TypeError means that the code is trying to perform an operation on a value that is not of the expected type.
//
//     Fix the TypeError by updating the document.queryselector method to the correct method name that selects an element from the DOM.

// Step 5 
// CamperBot has created a new variable called bgHexCodeSpanElement to store the reference to the span element with the id of bg-hex-code. However, when they try to log that variable to the console, they get null.
//
//     null is a special value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a value. This can happen when you try to access a property of an object that doesn't exist.
//
// In this case, CamperBot is not passing in the correct selector to the document.querySelector method.
//
//     Fix the document.querySelector("bg-hex-code") line so that it correctly selects the element with the id of bg-hex-code.

const body = document.querySelector("body");
const bgHexCodeSpanElement = document.querySelector("#bg-hex-code");

// Step 6 
// CamperBot has now created a function called changeBackgroundColor that changes the background color of the page to a random color from the darkColorsArr array. The function also displays the hex code for that new color.
//
// When they try to test out this function, they notice that the background color is not changing and the text shows the following:
//
//     Example Code
// Hex Code: undefined
// undefined is showing up here because the color variable is not being set correctly.
//
//     Fix the error in the darkColorsArr[getRandomIndex] line so that the color variable is set to a random color from the darkColorsArr array.
function changeBackgroundColor() {
    const color = darkColorsArr[getRandomIndex()];

    bgHexCodeSpanElement.innerText = color;
    body.style.backgroundColor = color;
}

// Step 7 
// CamperBot is trying to create a new variable called btn to store the reference to the button element with the id of click-btn
//
// However, when they try to log the button element to the console, they see that the button element is null.
//
//     Open up the index.html to see the correct id name for that button element.
//
//     Then fix the error for the document.querySelector("#click-btn"); line.

const btn = document.querySelector("#btn");

// Step 8 
// CamperBot has finished building out their random background color changer. However, when they click the button, the background color does not change.
//
//     It looks like they are trying to use the onclick property but they are using it incorrectly. The onclick property should be assigned a function reference.
//
// Fix the error in the btn.onclick = changeBackgroundColor(); line.
//
//     Remember that you worked with the onclick property in the Role playing game project. Look back at the final solution to see how onclick was properly used.
//
//     Once you fix that finalbug, the random background color changer will be complete!

btn.onclick = changeBackgroundColor;
